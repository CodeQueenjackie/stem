    <h1>WOMEN IN STEM</h1><br>
    <h2>Encouraging women to join STEM courses</h2>
    <img src="../images/stem1" alt=""><br>
    <P>Here are some of the ways we can Encourage women to join technical courses;</P>
    <li>1.Find a Mentor</li><br>
    <p>One way to encourage female interest is by featuring women who are in STEM or have made valuable contributions to STEM. According to a study conducted by Microsoft, girls are far more likely to feel empowered in STEM when they know a woman in a STEM profession. A visible role model they can look upto.

    </p><br>
    <li>2.Partner With Community</li><br>
    <p>Most girls lose interest in STEM during their teenage years; some studies identify age 15 as a significant drop-off point. We need to be reaching girls before they start losing interest. Companies can partner with local schools and other organizations and institutions to speak to girls about the opportunities in STEM.

    </p>
    <p>Allowing girls to do hands-on STEM activities helps them to see the value in STEM careers. Many young women are increasingly citing the ability to make a difference as a driving force in choosing a career path. Exposing younger girls to a variety of fields and helping them to see the potential impact on the world through efforts in those fields can only be beneficial as we look to create tomorrow’s workforce.  This helps them picture themselves in these professional roles someday.

    <li>3.Build Their Confidence</li><br>
    <p>Recent research has suggested that girls underperform in tasks in which they have to “think like scientists”, as they have pre-conceived notions that this is a masculine trait and one that relies on natural ability. To combat this, we need to reconfigure their views on what it means to be a scientist, with a more accurate emphasis on the importance of trial-and-error and where setbacks are central to scientific advancement.
